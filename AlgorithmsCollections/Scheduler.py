4. https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/
pesudo-code: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting
solution: topological sort(BFS, DFS)

BFS: topological sort (Kahn's algorithm: BFS) 
step 1: put all the courses that do not have any required courses into the queue, visited.add()
step 2: do the BFS(Note: only if all the prerequisite courses have been added to outputResult, 
        then we can add this course to output).
        
DFS:
approach 1: DFS
(visited(permanant), recursion_stack, cur_node)

step 1: start dfs from all the nodes that do not have ancestors
step 2: need to detect if there is any cycle

PESUDO-CODE(DFS):
    L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
    while exists nodes without a permanent mark do
        select an unmarked node n
        visit(n)
